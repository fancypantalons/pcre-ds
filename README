This is a hacked up version of the PCRE library.  Note, this is *not* an
official PCRE distribution, and as such, don't go to them for support.

Anyway, to build, make sure your environment is set up to use devkitarm 
correctly, and then do a 'make'.  To install:

1. Copy lib/libpcre9.a to libnds/lib
2. Copy include/pcre.h to libnds/include
3. Optionally copy include/pcreposix.h to libnds/include.
